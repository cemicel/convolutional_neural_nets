Convolutional Neural Network.

The task is to recognize text font.

Data set is generated by data_generator.py

Before generate the data, text file with names of fonts needs to be provided to work directory.
  To generate the data run:
- python3 data_generator.py <mode> <numb of instances per class>

Two data sets need to be created with mode: <training> and <test>, number of instances is arbitrary.
